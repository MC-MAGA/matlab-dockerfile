# Create a MATLAB Container Image

This repository shows you how to build and customize a Docker&reg; container for MATLAB&reg; and its toolboxes, using the [MATLAB Package Manager (*mpm*)](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md). 

You can use this container image as a scalable and reproducible method to deploy and test your MATLAB code.

You can also download prebuilt images based on this Dockerfile from [here](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/pkgs/container/matlab-dockerfile%2Fmatlab). For alternative resources, see [More MATLAB Docker Resources](#more-matlab-docker-resources).

### Requirements
* [A Running Network License Manager for MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/administer-network-licenses.html)
    * For more information, see [Using the Network License Manager](#use-the-network-license-manager)
* Docker

## Build Instructions

### Get Sources

Access this Dockerfile either by directly downloading this repository from GitHub&reg;,
or by cloning this repository and
then navigating to the appropriate folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile.git
cd matlab-dockerfile
```

### Build & Run Docker Image

Build container with a name and tag of your choice.
```bash
docker build -t matlab:R2024a .
```

Run the container. Test the container by running an example MATLAB command such as ver.
```bash
docker run --init --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:R2024a -batch ver
```
The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) defaults to building a container for MATLAB R2024a.

The example command `ver` displays the version number of MATLAB and other installed products. For more information, see [ver](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ver.html). For more information on running the container, see the section on [Running the Container](#run-the-container).

> **Note**
>
> Using the `--init` flag in the `docker run` command ensures that the container stops gracefully when a `docker stop` or `docker kill` command is issued.
> For more information, see the following links:
> * [Docker run reference page](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#init).
> * [Blog post on the usage of init](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-init-parameter).


## Customize the Image

By default, the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) installs MATLAB for the latest available MATLAB release without any additional toolboxes or products in the `/opt/matlab/${MATLAB_RELEASE}` folder.

Use the options below to customize your build.

### Customize MATLAB Release, MATLAB Product List, MATLAB Install Location and License Server
The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile) supports the following Docker build-time variables:

| Argument Name | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [MATLAB_RELEASE](#build-an-image-for-a-different-release-of-matlab) | R2024a | The MATLAB release you want to install, in lower-case. For example: `R2019b`|
| [MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST](#build-an-image-with-a-specific-set-of-products) | MATLAB | Products to install as a space-separated list. For more information, see [MPM.md](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/MPM.md). For example: `MATLAB Simulink Deep_Learning_Toolbox Fixed-Point_Designer`|
| [MATLAB_INSTALL_LOCATION](#build-an-image-with-matlab-installed-to-a-specific-location) | /opt/matlab/R2024a | The path to install MATLAB. |
| [LICENSE_SERVER](#build-an-image-configured-to-use-a-license-server) | *unset* | The port and hostname of the machine that is running the Network License Manager, using the `port@hostname` syntax. For example: `27000@MyServerName` |

Use these arguments with the the `docker build` command to customize your image.
Alternatively, you can change the default values for these arguments directly in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-dockerfile/blob/main/Dockerfile).

#### Build an Image for a Different Release of MATLAB
For example, to build an image for MATLAB R2019b, use this command.
```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_RELEASE=R2019b -t matlab:R2019b .
```

#### Build an Image with a specific set of products
For example, to build an image with MATLAB and Simulink&reg;, use this command.
```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_PRODUCT_LIST='MATLAB Simulink' -t matlab:R2024a .
```

#### Build an Image with MATLAB installed to a specific location
For example, to build an image with MATLAB installed at /opt/matlab, use this command.
```bash
docker build --build-arg MATLAB_INSTALL_LOCATION='/opt/matlab' -t matlab:R2024a .
```

#### Build an Image Configured to Use a License Server

Including the license server information with the `docker build` command means you do not have to pass it when running the container.
```bash
# Build container with the License Server.
docker build --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName -t matlab:R2024a .

# Run the container, without needing to pass license information.
docker run --init --rm matlab:R2024a -batch ver
```

## Use the Network License Manager
This container requires a Network License Manager to license and run MATLAB. You will need either the port and hostname of the Network License Manager, or a `network.lic` file.

**Step 1**: Contact your system administrator, who can provide one of the following:

1. The address to your server, and the port it is running on. 
    For example: `27000@MyServerName.example.com`

2. A `network.lic` file which contains the following lines:
    ```bash
    # Sample network.lic
    SERVER MyServerName.example.com <optional-mac-address> 27000
    USE_SERVER
    ```

3. A `license.dat` file. Open the `license.dat` file, find the `SERVER` line, and either extract the `port@hostname`, or create a `network.lic` file by copying the `SERVER` line and adding a `USE_SERVER` line below it.

    ```bash
    # snippet from sample license.dat
    SERVER MyServerName.example.com <mac-address> 27000
    ```
---
**Step 2**: Use `port@hostname` or the `network.lic` file with either the `docker build` **or** the `docker run` command.

With the `docker build` command, either:

- Specify the `LICENSE_SERVER` build-arg.

    ```bash
    # Example
    docker build -t matlab:R2024a --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName .
    ```
- Use the `network.lic` file:
    1. Place the `network.lic` file in the same folder as the Dockerfile.
    1. Uncomment the line `COPY network.lic /opt/matlab/licenses/` in the Dockerfile.
    1. Run the docker build command **without** the `LICENSE_SERVER` build-arg:

    ```bash
    # Example
    docker build -t matlab:R2024a .
    ```
    
With the `docker run` command, use the `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable. For example:

```bash
docker run --init --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:R2024a -batch ver
```

## Run the Container
If you did not provide the license server information when building the image, then provide it when running the container. Set the environment variable `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` using the `-e` flag, with the  network license manager's location in the format `port@hostname`.

```bash
# Start MATLAB, print version information, and exit:
docker run --init --rm -e MLM_LICENSE_FILE=27000@MyServerName matlab:R2024a -batch ver
```

You can run the container **without** specifying `MLM_LICENSE_FILE` if you provided the license server information when building the image, as shown in the examples below.

### Run MATLAB in an Interactive Command Prompt
To start the container and run MATLAB in an interactive command prompt, execute:
```bash
docker run --init -it --rm matlab:R2024a
```
### Run MATLAB in Batch Mode
To start the container, run a MATLAB command, and then exit, execute:
```bash
# Container runs the command RAND in MATLAB and exits.
docker run --init --rm matlab:R2024a -batch rand
```

### Run MATLAB with Startup Options
To override the default behavior of the container and run MATLAB with any set of arguments, such as `-logfile`, execute:
```bash
docker run --init -it --rm matlab:R2024a -logfile "logfilename.log"
```
